        <h1>About me</h1>

<p>Hello,
My name is Shraddha Pandhe. Currently I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant in <a href="www.winlab.rutgers.edu">WINLAB, Rutgers University </a>. I am also a Masters Thesis student at Rutgers University. Currently I am working on a very interesting project, <a href="https://summer.winlab.rutgers.edu/projects/wiki/2012/Projects/Wireless_Cloud_Computing">Wireless Cloud Computing</a>. In this ongoing project, I am trying to build a cloud on locally, abundantly available smart handheld device. I finished a part of this project during my summer internship in WINLAB. </p>

<p>Before my summer internship, I worked as a Teaching Assistant at Rutgers University. In course Digital Logic Design, I conducted lab sessions for apprx 60 students. Never knew before that teaching could be so much fun! In another semester, I conducted recitations and problem review sessions for the course Principles of Communication Systems for a class of 35 students.</p>

<p>Before I joined Rutgers as a Masters Student, I worked with <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/IN/index.html">Cisco Systems Inc</a>, as a Software Engineer from July 2009 to July 2011. I handled billing requirements of over 60 GGSN customers. I developed a tool for parsing millions of CDRs (Charging Data Record). It goes through the record, field-by-field, and highlights any unexpected behavior. My job responsibilities also included analyzing the billing requirements of customers, and creating a Gap Analysis document, which highlights the gaps in existing implementation and requirement. To achieve this, I had to collaborate with many other teams for additional inputs and review comments. Overall, work experience in Cisco was very enriching. </p>

<p>Apart from all these, I like organizing and managing stuff. During my undergrad, I organized a bunch of technical and non-technical events, involving viewership of ~7000 people! The event I enjoyed the most was Regatta 2008. We also made a video, The Making of Regatta: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZkposf6tlM&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZkposf6tlM&amp;feature=related</a>. </p>

<p>As you would have guessed, I love Rowing! In fact, I won all possible awards that COEP has to offer, for a good rower, including Best Outgoing Sports Person! I know I am boasting, but I am really proud of it :)</p>

<p>Well, I guess this is it for now! Checkout my projects in Projects. </p>
